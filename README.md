# Super Midi Hero
CSC4263-ART4240 Group Project

Welcome to the repository for **Super Midi Hero**, a vaporwave-based mobile rhythm game. There's a few things you'll need to set up to properly build and play the game. 

## Playing the game in the Editor

The Unity editor can be used to play the game even though PC is not the intended platform. **Be sure to set the aspect ratio of the game to 9:16**. This mimics a standard phone's vertical display. 

When playing the game in the editor or on PC, clicking will navigate through menus, but the button pads in the main game are mapped to the keyboard. In easy mode, the keys are QWAS; advanced mode uses QWEASDZXC. 

## Install the APK on Android
You can get an APK of the game either by building it yourself with the directions below, or by downloading a prebuilt APK from [our website](http://xstgx.com/midihero/). This build is not automatically updated, so there's a possibility that it's outdated. 

## Building for Android

Android is our main target, but building for it is slightly tricky. Current versions of Unity have an incompatibility with current versions of the Android SDK, so an outdated (>25.3) SDK must be manually installed. Then, adjust the Unity preferences to use that Android tools folder.

## Building for iOS

Building for iOS is only possible on an Apple machine that has Xcode installed, so be sure to install that from the App Store and set up a developer account.
